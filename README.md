# E-store


#### I am creating Django project that consists of a fully featured online shop. This project contains essential functionalities of an e-commerce platform. The online shop will enable clients to browse products, add them to the cart,apply discount codes, go through the checkout process, pay with a credit card, and obtain an invoice. We'll implement a recommendation engine to recommend products to your customers, and use internationalization to offer your site in multiple languages.

- Create a product catalog
- Build a shopping cart using Django sessions
- Create custom context processors
- Manage customer orders
- Configure Celery in your project with RabbitMQ as a message broker
- Send asynchronous notifications to customers using Celery
- Monitor Celery using Flower
